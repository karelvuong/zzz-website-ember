        <p class="post-section-header-subtitle larger">A look into the design process.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="post-section-text larger">As my second project since <a href="">joining the Zazzle team as a Product Manager Intern</a> in January, I was tasked with redesigning the settings pages on Zazzle.com.</p>

      <p class="post-section-text">With a number of exciting initiatives ongoing within Zazzle, I took on the job of redesigning what some could consider to be the least exciting of pages on Zazzle.com. This is far from the truth. While not forward facing, the settings pages are just as important as Zazzle.com's product pages or search results. Any changes that need to be made to a user's profile and account settings, or a store owner's products, payment information, and tax settings are controlled on these pages. Information that users provide to us to manage their accounts and facilitate their businesses are entered here. </p>

      <p class="post-section-text">Like with the {{#link-to 'post.design-analysis-zazzle-maker'}}Zazzle Maker Dashboard{{/link-to}}, I took on the duo role of both a product designer and product manager. I created all designs, mockups, and wireframes using tools like <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop CC</a>. I also oversaw development of all settings pages.</p>

      <p class="post-section-text larger">To go hand in hand with the profile page redesign, the settings pages also needed a visual refresh.</p>

      <p class="post-section-text">The goal was to make the pages more usable, visually appealing, and complementary to the new design.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="post-section-text larger">Before I began, I set some guiding principles which were used to steer the decision making behind the design.</p>

      <p class="post-section-text">At a high level, I knew what the goals of the company were at the time. Within the scope of the project, it was important that we moved in parallel with other ongoing projects at the time. What this meant was that the settings pages needed to work together with other projects that affected the site. However other projects moved and weaved, the settings pages would have to move with it.</p>

      <p class="post-section-text"></p>

      <h2 class="post-section-title">Complement the New Design</h2>
      <p class="post-section-text">Designing an experience that is familiar and makes sense to the user is paramount. Consistency is key.</p>

      <h2 class="post-section-title">Respect the Past</h2>
      <p class="post-section-text">An issue that commonly arises when redesigning a widely used platform is the need to help current users . You need to strike a balance between giving the users something completely new and bringing users over into the new design in an elegant fashion.</p>

      <h2 class="post-section-title">Simplifying the Process</h2>
      <p class="post-section-text">Blah, blah, blah...</p>

      <p class="post-section-text larger">Once functional prototypes were finalized, we had to see if we were on the right track.</p>

      <p class="post-section-text">It is never wise to accept that your designs are perfect. With design comes iteration and it is important to realize that. Throughout the entire design process, tools like <a href="http://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel</a>, and <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> were continously used to present the designs and receive feedback. All Zazzle employees had access to this particular project in Basecamp and were free to view, comment, and provide their feedback on the designs as they were created. As new feedback was received, these were taken with a grain of salt and some decisions were made.</p>
