      <h1>Designing Zazzle.com Settings</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">A look into the design process.</p>

      <p class="lead">As my second project since <a href="">joining the Zazzle team as a Product Manager Intern</a> in January, I took on the task of redesigning the settings pages on Zazzle.com.</p>

      <p>I started this project in late March 2015. While there were a number of other exciting projects ongoing, I wanted to take on a project that I could work through from the beginning all the way to the very end - from ideation all the way to implementation. Coupled with the fact that my internship was coming to an end at the end of April 2015, this was the perfect project for me.</p>

      <p>While not entirely public facing, the settings pages play an instrumental role on Zazzle.com. Any changes that need to be made to a user's profile and account, or to a store owner's products and payment information are entered on these pages.</p>

      <p><strong>Like with the {{#link-to 'post.design-analysis-zazzle-maker'}}Zazzle Maker Dashboard{{/link-to}}, I took on the duo role of both a product designer and product manager.</strong> I was the primary designer and was responsible for the creation of all designs, mockups, and wireframes. I also worked together with another Product Manager to define specifications and manage development for the implementation of the settings pages.</p>

      <h1>Objectives</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">The goal of the project was to make modifying your settings a breeze.</p>

      <p class="lead">We wanted the pages to be more usable, accessible, and visually appealing.</p>

      <p>To go hand in hand with the new profile design, the settings pages were a prime candidate to accompany the redesign. We wanted to improve the experience of modifying your user and store settings by providing users with a seamless way of transitioning from viewing their profile to editing their profile and settings.</p>

      <h1>Initial State</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">What it started out as.</p>

      <p>Prior to the redesign, user testing found that users found the settings to be difficult to access and confusing to navigate. Here is a summary of our findings:</p>

      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p>A user's settings was accessed by hovering over the icon of the member's profile picture in the header and clicking <strong>My Accounts</strong> or <strong>Edit Profile</strong>. Modifying your profile on a different page may lead to some confusion as you are no longer on the page you are editing. Sites like Facebook and Houzz address this by allowing users to edit their information from directly on the profile.</p>

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>Related to the points made above, editing your profile information or account settings performed on pages that look very similar and generic, making it difficult to distinguish whether you are within the member context or the store context.</p>

      <h2>Navigation</h2>
      <p>In its current state, it is unclear how to navigate to different sections of the user and store settings. While the flow was designed to be hierarchical, sections are displayed as though they all sit on the same level, despite being a child of a parent. The navigation boils down to a horizontal navigation bar and a side panel.</p>

      <h3>Horizontal Navigation Bar</h3>
      <p>The horizontal navigation bar is the primary form of navigation within the settings pages.</p>

      <h1>Research and Usability Testing</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">A little research goes a long way.</p>

      <p class="lead">Before jumping into the project, we wanted to take a look at where we stood as a platform.</p>

      <p>To do so, we had a few questions that we wanted answers to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What do our users love and what do they dislike about the current settings pages?</li>
        <li>What are our competitors doing?</li>
        <li>What are the current design trends these days for editing a profile or managing account settings?</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Guiding Principles</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">These were used to steer the decision making behind each design and iteration.</p>

      <p class="lead">It's easy to get lost and diverge from the goal.</p>

      <p>At a high level, I knew what the goals of the company were at the time. Within the scope of the project, it was important that we moved in parallel with other ongoing projects at the time. What this meant was that the settings pages needed to work together with other projects that affected the site. However other projects moved and weaved, the settings pages would have to move with it.</p>

      <h2>Simplicity</h2>
      <p>Blah, blah, blah...</p>

      <h2>Complement the New Design</h2>
      <p>Designing an experience that is familiar and makes sense to the user is paramount. Consistency is key.</p>

      <h2>Respect the Past</h2>
      <p>An issue that commonly arises when redesigning a widely used platform is the need to help current users . You need to strike a balance between giving the users something completely new and bringing users over into the new design in an elegant fashion.</p>

      <h2>Add More Structure</h2>

      <p class="lead">Once functional prototypes were finalized, we had to see if we were on the right track.</p>

      <p>It is never wise to accept that your designs are perfect. With design comes iteration and it is important to realize that. Throughout the entire design process, tools like , , and <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> were continously used to present the designs and receive feedback. All Zazzle employees had access to this particular project in Basecamp and were free to view, comment, and provide their feedback on the designs as they were created. As new feedback was received, these were taken with a grain of salt and some decisions were made.</p>

      <p>There are countless tools out there that are used by different companies and different people. Personally, I am always curious as to what others are using when they go about working on a project. So, here is a list of things I used while working on Zazzle.com Settings!</p>

        <li><a href="http://jira.com/">JIRA</a>: Initially, the entire company was using Asana for project management. This changed at the beginning of March when myself and two other individuals led the charge on migrating all management of engineering projects over to JIRA.</li>
